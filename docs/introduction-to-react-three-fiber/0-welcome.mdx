For this workshop we use a pre-configured development environments directly embedded into this website that allow you to follow all steps directly in the browser:

<Sandpack
  template="react-ts"
  files={{
    '/App.tsx': `
export default function App() {
  return (
    <h4>This is a embedded development environment</h4>
  )
}`}}/>

We will start with the workshop section "Introduction to React Three Fiber". Each step of this workshop section provides its own pre-configured embedded development environment at the top, which contains the solution for the previous step, followed by tasks that should be applied inside the development environment.

If you prefer having one development environment for all parts of this tutorial, you can also open a development environment up into a seperate tab by click `Open Sandbox` in the bottom right corner and continue applying all tasks inside this tab.

In the next step, we'll directly begin building our first React Three Fiber app. Please follow the link on the bottom right to continue.
