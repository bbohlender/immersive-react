title: Create a Mesh

Let's begin creating a React Three Fiber app by replacing our `div` from the previous code with a `Canvas`, which sets up our 3D scene. We use `style={{ position: "absolute", inset: "0", touchAction: "none" }}` to fill the screen with the canvas.

The following development environment already has the canvas setup, follow the instructions below to add the first mesh to the scene.

<Sandpack codeViewer
  template="react-ts"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      'three': '~0.168.0',
      '@react-three/fiber': 'latest'
    },
  }}
  files={{
    '/App.tsx': `import { Canvas, Vector3 } from "@react-three/fiber";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas style={{ position: "absolute", inset: "0", touchAction: "none" }}>
      {/* add your code here */}
    </Canvas>
  )
}`}}/>


Your first task is to add 3D content into the `Canvas`. For that we create a new component called `MyComponent` that returns a **mesh** containing a **boxGeometry** and a **meshBasicMaterial** with color `"red"` to render a red box. We pass an optional position attribute to `MyComponent` of type Vector3 so we can define multiple instances of `MyComponent` at different positions in the 3D space.

The code for `MyComponent` looks like this:
```tsx
function MyComponent({ position }: { position?: Vector3 }) {
    return <mesh position={position}>
        <boxGeometry/>
        <meshBasicMaterial color="red" />
    </mesh>
}
```

Now we can add an instance of `MyComponent` into the Canvas at position `0,0,0`.

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <MyComponent position={[0,0,0]} />
</Canvas>
```

In the next part, we will add interactions and state to our first component.
